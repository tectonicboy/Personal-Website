                I am Kevin Stefanov, a software engineer by<br>
                profession, experienced primarily in low-level<br>
                systems development. I very much enjoy<br>
                learning the intricacies of how the underlying<br>
                hardware architecture of a modern computer<br>
                works as well as what compilers do to our code.<br><br><br>
                
                A particularly big fascination of mine are advanced<br> 
                software optimization techniques and ways to aid the<br> 
                compiler in generating better assembly code and to<br>
                aid the underlying hardware in executing it faster.<br><br><br>

                If you're here to hire me - I only work remote.

                This was my first job after university. In this role, I was
                developing Xen Hypervisor, which is a bare-metal virtualization engine that<br>
                implements virtualized hardware devices and brings up and runs
                virtualized operating systems. I was learning and working primarily<br>
                with C and x86 assembly language and learning about hardware
                architecture and how it affects modern operating systems design.<br>  
                I left because I got tired of living in England and wanted to move
                back to my home country of Bulgaria, where I've been much happier.

                In this role I was developing the flagship operating system for
                IBM System Z machines - z/OS. I used daily a mixture of system-level<br>
                languages: C, assembly language, and PL/X - IBM's internal
                low-level language for OS development. A good portion of my time<br>
                was spent reading compiler-generated assembly language code to
                debug a frozen running instace of the operating system. I also<br>
                trained other IBM developers who weren't coming from a low-level
                programming background. I left because of poor management<br>
                and compensation not growing as competitively as an OS developer 
                using assembly language almost daily should be getting.<br><br><br>

                Job 3 - Developer of highly optimized low-level systems at Ravendao [starting January 2025]

                My main responsibility here is to develop advanced software optimizations
                to Raven's high frequency algorithmic trading system.<br><br>
                
                My first project is to implement a low-level OS kernel bypass for UDP
                networking. The Linux Kernel handles this entirely for us right now,<br>
                as it does in every usual system. The kernel bypass system will instead
                be reading UDP packets directly from the hardware network card <br>
                and sending them directly to it via a userspace network card driver and 
                parsing/constructing UDP packets using a custom implementation<br>
                of the IP and UDP protocols, completely replacing the Linux Kernel's implementation
                of these protocols, bypassing it entirely to boost speed.<br><br>

                This is an advanced optimization to the HFT system. It eliminates
                costly context switches between user space and kernel space, avoids<br>
                the usage of needlessly huge and bloated over time in-kernel data structures
                for general network handling and allows for specialized<br>
                optimizations geared toward the architecture of the specific CPU
                the system is running on, like custom cache-aware memory allocation.<br>
