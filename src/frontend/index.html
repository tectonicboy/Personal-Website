                I am Kevin Stefanov, a software engineer by<br>
                profession, experienced primarily in low-level<br>
                systems development. I very much enjoy<br>
                learning the intricacies of how the underlying<br>
                hardware architecture of a modern computer<br>
                works as well as what compilers do to our code.<br><br><br>
                
                A particularly big fascination of mine are advanced<br> 
                software optimization techniques and ways to aid the<br> 
                compiler in generating better assembly code and to<br>
                aid the underlying hardware in executing it faster.<br><br><br>

            <span style="font-size: 0.8vw;">
                This was my first job after university. In this role, I was
                developing Xen Hypervisor, which is a bare-metal virtualization engine that<br>
                implements virtualized hardware devices and brings up and runs
                virtualized operating systems. I was learning and working primarily<br>
                with C and x86 assembly language and learning about hardware
                architecture and how it affects modern operating systems design.<br>  
                I left because I got tired of living in England and wanted to move
                back to my home country of Bulgaria, where I've been much happier.

                In this role I was developing the flagship operating system for
                IBM System Z machines - z/OS. I used daily a mixture of system-level<br>
                languages: C, assembly language, and PL/X - IBM's internal
                low-level language for OS development. A good portion of my time<br>
                was spent reading compiler-generated assembly language code to
                debug a frozen running instace of the operating system. I also<br>
                trained other IBM developers who weren't coming from a low-level
                programming background. I left because of poor management<br>
                and compensation not growing as competitively as an OS developer 
                using assembly language almost daily should be getting.<br><br><br>

            <span style="font-size: 0.8vw;">
                
                My main responsibility here is to develop advanced software optimizations
                to Raven's high frequency algorithmic trading system.<br><br>
                
                My first project is to implement a low-level OS kernel bypass for UDP
                networking. The Linux Kernel handles this entirely for us right now,<br>
                as it does in every usual system. The kernel bypass system will instead
                be reading UDP packets directly from the hardware network card <br>
                and sending them directly to it via a userspace network card driver and 
                parsing/constructing UDP packets using a custom implementation<br>
                of the IP and UDP protocols, completely replacing the Linux Kernel's implementation
                of these protocols, bypassing it entirely to boost speed.<br><br>

                This is an advanced optimization to the HFT system. It eliminates
                costly context switches between user space and kernel space, avoids<br>
                the usage of needlessly huge and bloated over time in-kernel data structures
                for general network handling and allows for specialized<br>
                optimizations geared toward the architecture of the specific CPU
                the system is running on, like custom cache-aware memory allocation.<br>

                This website is itself a project of mine, all be it a quick one and unlike the projects
                I typically work on. I wrote the frontend part in plain HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br>
                For the backend, I wrote an HTTP web server in C, to which the DNS servers send
                requests to access my website. The C web server simply listens for connections,<br>
                accepts legit ones and serves the necessary code and other files for the website

                My first non-trivial project from a few years ago was to write a website in HTML, CSS and
                Javascript with the slight detail that I also wrote its 
                <span style="color:rgb(239, 245, 66);">HTTP web server by myself in C</span><br>
                using Linux Sockets, as well as a minimal
                <span style="color:rgb(239, 245, 66);"> relational database engine</span> that included 
                me coming up with a<span style="color:rgb(239, 245, 66);"> custom query language </span>
                for it and implementing it in C++. My website's<br>
                HTTP server that I wrote in C was connecting to my custom database system with AF_UNIX sockets 
                and sending it commands written in my custom query language.<br><br>
                
                The other cool non-trivial project from a few years ago that I did was implementing 
                <span style="color:rgb(239, 245, 66);">Tetris and Snake in C</span> 
                to run on a Linux terminal. I had emulated the game screen with an array of ASCII<br>
                characters, which contained sections separated by newlines, to draw a 2D game screen. I had
                emulated the framerate by continuously rewriting the string with printf(). Player controls<br>
                were implemented by disabling terminal canonical mode and having a separate thread listen
                for keyboard input. Collision detection made sure the snake died any time it would hit its tail.<br><br>

                    For over a year I've been developing from scratch in C 
                    <span style="color:rgb(239, 245, 66);">a system for secure instant messaging.</span>
                    It's nearing 10,000 lines of mostly C code. For this, I've implemented 4 major things:
                    <ul>
                    
                        <li>
                            An optimized function library in C for representing and doing math on huge numbers 
                            with thousands of digits. Here I've implemented some rather complex algorithms <br>
                            such as multiple-precision division, Rabin-Miller prime number locator and 
                            Montgomery Modular Multiplication. The library hasn't been optimized for minimal<br>
                            cache misses yet and already computes (A<sup>B</sup> mod M) in 0.0053 seconds, where A and M 
                            are 3070-bit and B is a 320-bit unsigned integer, on a Ryzen 9 desktop CPU.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            An optimized function library in C containing my own implementations of cryptography
                            algorithms - Blake2b, ChaCha20, Argon2 and a generator/validator of Schnorr Signatures.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            A TCP client in C that runs on the user's machine. The user's long-term keys are encrypted
                            behind a (non-stored) password with Argon2. At login, their long-term keys are conveyed to the TCP<br>
                            server via another, short-term pair of keys and Diffie Hellman shared secret. Then a
                            session-wide Diffie Hellman shared secret is generated for the actual texting session to begin.<br>
                            To send a text message to everyone else in their chatroom, a 3-layer deep key scheme is
                            used: First, a random one-time use 32-byte key K is generated. That key is itself encrypted with ChaCha20<br>
                            using symmetric session keys KAB/KBA obtained from the shared secret, which itself comes
                            from the long-term 3070-bit / 320-bit public/private keys of both sides. The un-encrypted version <br>
                            of one-time key K is used in ChaCha20 to encrypt the text message network packet payload that's to be 
                            secured in transit. The receiver does the security scheme in reverse to obtain the text message.<br><br> 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            A TCP server in C that maintains all the connected clients and the chatrooms they are currently in,
                            with its own cryptographic artifacts and shared secrets, which it only uses to communicate with<br>
                            individual clients securely. A text message sent by a user cannot be decrypted by the TCP server,
                            because clients use a different shared secret obtained with the other client's long-term public<br>
                            and private keys. The TCP server never initiates a transmission, instead it either gets asked by
                            a TCP client for something, like creating a new chatroom, or is polled several times a second by<br>
                            ALL clients, in order to relay to them any pending transmissions like a text message sent by someone 
                            else in the chatroom the clients are currently in. It can also detect dead client connections.
